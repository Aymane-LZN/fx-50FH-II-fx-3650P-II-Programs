# Polynomial Expansion

Theoretically, the algorithm used in this program is capable of expanding any polynomial in one variable of any degree. However, due to the precision of the calculator itself, the persicion of the smaller coefficient would be affected or the smaller coefficient may even appear as zero if the difference in magnitude between coefficients is too great.

It is important to note that the run time of the program increases expotentiall with respect to the degree of the polynomial to be expanded. (Runtime O(n^2))
